# Feeling about building a webpage:
- Lot to do
- Tedious
- With time can do it

# Where to start:
- Get the HTML going
- Placement of divs
- Maybe have just the elements and fill in the text later

# What elements do we see:
- img
- div
- table, tr, th, td
- p
- h1

# What type of styling to we see:
- background image
- position of elements
- border
- font/color
- padding and margin


# Before exam:
- Think about what steps you can take to help make the exam easier
    - Have notes or previous code handy
    - Maybe take a screenshot of the exam image and make it the background image so you can possibly better line up the elements
    - Have validator, w3schools, cssTricks, geekforgeeks open in case they are needed
    - Have the lecture playlist open
    - Have a trouble shooting doc ready for testing
    - Have the folder with html , css and js files in and already linked
